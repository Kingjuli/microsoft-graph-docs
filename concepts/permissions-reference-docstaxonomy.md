# Microsoft Graph permissions reference

For an app to access data in Microsoft Graph, the user or administrator must grant it the permissions it needs. This topic lists the delegated and application permissions exposed by Microsoft Graph. For guidance about how to use the permissions, see the [Overview of Microsoft Graph permissions](permissions-overview.md).

To find the unique identifiers for all permissions, see [All permissions and IDs](#all-permissions-and-ids).

To read information about all Microsoft Graph permissions programmatically, sign-in to Graph Explorer using an account that has at least the *Application.Read.All* permission and run the following request.

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/servicePrincipals(appId='00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000')?$select=id,appId,displayName,appRoles,oauth2PermissionScopes
```
