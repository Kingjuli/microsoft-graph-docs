# Microsoft Graph Data Connect policies and billing

Microsoft Graph Data Connect uses [Azure managed applications](/azure/managed-applications/overview)â€”enabling you to create and deploy solutions in your Azure environment. Managed applications support specific Azure policies, providing you greater confidence when using your applications.

## Policies

Azure-managed applications built with Microsoft 365 data support these Azure policies:

- [Azure Policy built-in definitions for Azure Storage](/azure/storage/common/policy-reference)
- [Introduction to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction)
- [Azure Policy built-in definitions for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1](/azure/data-lake-store/policy-reference)

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 and Gen2 use different policies because Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 implements Azure Storage.

When you select any of the policies during Azure Marketplace publishing, the policy compliance status is checked and enforced for all installations of your application. Selected policies in compliance are shown to the data approvers as part of the data request. Policy compliance violations will cause the pipeline run to fail, and stop the data extraction.
